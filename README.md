# PONG.exe
.exe version of my pygame PONG (https://github.com/Kai-Guan/PONG)

.exe made using auto-py-to-exe (https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/)

Download and extract .zip file.

If you run pong.exe now, windows antivirus will flag the .exe and delete it. Therefore for windows:

  Go to Windows Security
  
  Virus and threat protection
  
  Manage settings
  
  Add exclusion
  
  Select the pong.exe

Run exe\PONG\pong.exe

It should now run as intended.

Works on Windows 11 for me, other Operation Systems untested.
